      <h3>I wish I had had access to a tool like ARC when I was serving as a State Department diplomat and policymaker.</h3>
      <p>Adoption of ARC by national security and diplomatic agencies would significantly enhance analysis and decisionmaking. ARC can enforce rigorous methodologies and provide forecasting capabilities beyond current training. This would improve the clarity of U.S. Government analysis and the efficacy of policy decisions."</p>

        <h2>AI That Thinks Like an Intelligence Analyst</h2>
        <p>
          ARC isn't just another AI tool - it's purpose-built to replicate the methods used by the world's top analysts. Developed in collaboration with intelligence professionals, corporate strategists, and policy experts, ARC transforms complex analytical processes into intuitive, AI-powered workflows.</p>
        <p>
          Start with a critical question or issue you would like to explore — called your "ARC," then watch as ARCbot gets to work drafting the building blocks of your analysis.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Scenario Development</h3>
        <p>
          Generate and refine future scenarios with precision. Explore possible outcomes and track their likelihood over time. <i>Reduce uncertainty with scenario assessments that create strategic foresight.</i></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Decomposition</h3>
        <p>
          Automatically map drivers and signals using structured analytical techniques pioneered by legendary CIA analyst Richard Heuer. Break down complex problems into their component parts to identify key influencers and measurable signals. <i>Accomplish in seconds what used to require multi-day workshops with experts.</i></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>Crowdsourced Forecasting</h3>
          <p>
            Solicit crowdsourced probabilistic predictions from colleagues or network directly in ARC – or leverage one of Cultivate’s partner sites to capture an informed public perspective. <i>Gain human insight that’s still essential for high-stakes issues.</i></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Global Intelligence Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            ARC continuously scans the global information landscape in near real-time, identifying relevant sources, translating from local languages, summarizing key points, and analyzing for bias. <i>Ensure you never miss a critical signal.</i></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Advanced Cognitive Bias Detection</h3>
          <p>
            Deploy powerful "red teaming" methods to identify analytical blind spots in both your writing and sources. <i>Deliver assessments without the cognitive biases that affect even the sharpest analysts—before they shape key decisions.</i></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h5>Policy &amp; Decision Drafts with Risk Identification</h5>
            <p>
              Give ARC an objective and it will draft options for policies or decisions to implement. ARC will also identify risks to be mindful of if you are to implement any of the policies or decisions. You can even draft your own policy or decision and ARC will still identify possible risks. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Collaboration</h5>
            <p>
              ARC is designed to let AI be your co-pilot on analytic tasks. You are free to add, remove, and edit anything it creates. You can also invite as many people as you’d like to collaborate with you or view your work.

          <div>
            <h5>LLM Agnostic</h5>
            <p>
